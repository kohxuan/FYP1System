### üöÄ Getting Started: Setting Up Locally

This application is designed to run on a local machine. Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

> **Prerequisites:**
> 1.  **.NET 9 SDK**: [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
> 2.  **Visual Studio 2022**: [Download here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Ensure the **"ASP.NET and web development"** workload is installed.
> 3.  **Microsoft SQL Server**: A `(localdb)\mssqllocaldb` instance is required, which is typically installed with Visual Studio.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **üìÇ Extract Project Files**
    -   Download and unzip the project archive (`FYP1System.zip`) to a local directory.

2.  **‚úèÔ∏è Open the Solution**
    -   Launch Visual Studio 2022.
    -   Open the solution file **`FYP1System.sln`** from the extracted directory.
    -   Visual Studio will automatically restore all the required NuGet package dependencies.

3.  **üóÉÔ∏è Create and Seed the Database**
    -   In Visual Studio, go to **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**.
    -   Once the console is ready, run the following command. This will connect to your local SQL Server instance, create the database, apply the schema, and populate it with initial data (including user roles and sample accounts).
        ```powershell
        Update-Database
        ```

4.  **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Project**
    -   Press **F5** or click the green run button (with "https" profile) in the main toolbar.
